# PythonPalindrome
Writing a program in python to check to see if a word is a palindrome or not. 


While looking at data scientist interview questions, one article stated that one of the questions asked by Microsoft was to write a program to check if a word is a palindrome or not. Since I've been learning about Python, I thought I'd spend a few minutes to write a short palindrome function in using Python.
